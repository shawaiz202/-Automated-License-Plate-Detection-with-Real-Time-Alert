# -Automated-License-Plate-Detection-with-Real-Time-Alert

Welcome to the Automated Number Plate Detection System! This project leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and read vehicle number plates from images or video streams. The system is designed to be robust and efficient, utilizing machine learning techniques for number plate localization and text extraction.
